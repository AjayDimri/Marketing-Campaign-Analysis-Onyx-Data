In this project, I refined my skills in data cleaning and transformation, including adjusting data types, renaming columns for clarity, and enhancing my search capabilities. The result is a comprehensive two-page dashboard featuring an Engagement View and a Finance View, with intuitive buttons for seamless navigation between pages.
